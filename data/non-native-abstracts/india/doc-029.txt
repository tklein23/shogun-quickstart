In this paper we study the chaotic behaviour of the heat semigroup generated
by the Dunkl-Laplacian on weighted $ L^p$ spaces. In the case of the heat
semigroup associated to the standard Laplacian we obtain a complete picture
on
the spaces $ L^p(\R^n, (\varphi_{i\rho}(x))^2 dx) $ where $ \varphi_{i\rho}
$
is the Euclidean spherical function. The behaviour is very similar to the
case
of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces
studied by Pramanik and Sarkar.
