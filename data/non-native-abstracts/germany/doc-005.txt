The accurate identification of chemicals in text is important for many
applications, including computer-assisted reconstruction of metabolic
networks or retrieval of information about substances in drug development.
But due to the diversity of naming conventions and traditions for such
molecules, this task is highly complex and should be supported by
computational tools.
We present ChemSpot, a named entity recognition (NER) tool for identifying
mentions of chemicals in natural language texts, including trivial names,
drugs, abbreviations, molecular formulas and International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry entities. Since the different classes of relevant entities
have rather different naming characteristics, ChemSpot uses a hybrid
approach combining a Conditional Random Field with a dictionary. It achieves
an F(1) measure of 68.1% on the SCAI corpus, outperforming the only other
freely available chemical NER tool, OSCAR4, by 10.8 percentage points.
